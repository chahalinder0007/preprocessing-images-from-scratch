# preprocessing-images-from-scratch
The project covers the deficit that exist in the online available resources in data science for beginners, whereby the existing models work just fine on well prepared mnist, fashion-mnist etc datasets but often students find it difficult to achieve the kind of accuracy for their own datasets. The project intends to cover simple methods to generate a good dataset from different images obtained from any sources.  



Requirements: although the requirements have been taken care of as the script will initialize and install the required dependencies but here is a list anyway:

- scipy
- opencv
- sklearn
- pywt
- numpy
- math


The best suggested method is to use a jupyter notebook to open the mainn.ipynb file. it will execute all the required files. The files are assumed to be mnist type where each image is placed in a directory which is its label.
